I came across this family yesterday. Both the parents are handicapped and normal life would seem hard for people with such disabilities. It took them around 10 min just to walk from the shop to the auto. Even with such hardships, people find the courage and have a sense of responsibility to raise a family. Even with such hardships, the smile is undeterred.



Hope you find some inspiration through this!!!
